# BUGS 

# Features to implement
- Fix horrific coupling etc.
- Change spawning locations so that they don't spawn in walls etc.
- Add play again option after game over.

Maybe would be OK if goldbugs didn't attack player.
	- Damage player health when goldbug runs into player
	- Make goldbugs target player (maybe choose whoever is closer as target)

# DONE :D- Levels (increasing difficulty); ideas:
- Randomise spawn locations? 
- Faster spawn rates
- More violent bugs that wake up monster faster 
- Game over state 
- Make the goldbugs spawn in more interesting ways
	- Enable addition of additional spawn points in the future (for higher levels,
	  for instance). 
- Change spawn characteristics:
    - Rather than having everything spawn at once from every location, 
      randomly choose spawn location from a number of possible locations.
