## Description
This is a small project mostly for the purposes of learning the basics
of the Unity 3D game engine. 

The game is a first-person shooter in which the player is hunting for rare
golden bugs in a cave. Unfortunately, the cave also contains a monster which
will wake if annoyed by the bugs, or if the player accidentally shoots it.
I am currently deciding whether the bugs attack the player as well. 

## Play the game
